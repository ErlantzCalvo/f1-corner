# F1-corner üèÅ‚Äã

This is a web page created using the Astro web framework whose objective is to see how Fernando "el nano" Alonso wins his 33rd race. Well, you can also see the season information of the rest of the F1 drivers and constructors.




## Demo

The website can be accessed at the following link: https://f1-corner-iota.vercel.app/


## Acknowledgements

This project generates a static web page with the data retrieved from https://ergast.com/mrd/ at build time. Note that the data displayed is not actually dynamic, that is not the idea behind this project. Since the F1 races are held (almost) always on sundays, this page is built every monday in order to retrieve the new races data. 

You may be thinking that the best approach would have been to obtain the data dynamically, but again, that was not the intention of this project. The main idea was to experiment the full power of static Astro webpage.
